# ChatGPT
We have two versions:
advanced and update
The updated version is more accurate, but can't understand the context. 
The advanced version is not very accurate, but can understand the context.
All of two versions will create a new local file(It will not upload to the cloud!)named api_token.json
And when you exit the program the data will be cleared.
